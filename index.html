                    <h2>Background Information</h2>
                    <p>In 1984, a devastating event unfolded in India that deeply impacted my family and countless others in the Sikh community. Operation Blue Star and the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi led to widespread anti-Sikh riots, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Sikhs and massive displacement. My family, like many others, faced brutal violence and feared for their lives every day. Forced to flee their homeland, their journey ultimately brought them to the United States to seek safety and a new beginning.</p>

                    <h2>Historical Context</h2>
                    <p>The 1984 Sikh genocide was triggered by Operation Blue Star, a military operation ordered by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to remove Sikh militants from the Golden Temple in Amritsar. This was followed by her assassination by her Sikh bodyguards, which led to anti-Sikh riots across India. Thousands of Sikhs were killed, and many more were displaced from their homes.</p>

                    <h2>Impact on My Family</h2>
                    <p>1984 had a huge impact on my family's life but also how it changed me and my siblings' lives forever. My parents lived in constant fear of what is going to happen next and overall just felt unsafe living in India during these times. My parents had known each other long before they got married in 1996 but since it was so dangerous they wanted to wait until they got to the United States until they got married for the safety of the family they were trying to create. But prior to this all my family had always lived in India their whole lives.</p>
